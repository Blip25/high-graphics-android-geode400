# High graphics on Android

This is where she makes a mod.

### Disclaimer: Please download the high graphics textures from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ceS-g-DwIWerTgFPVnjglhtbcmGx1WrA/view?usp=sharing), and load it using Texture Loader, as Android doesn't have the high textures by default

Adds support for High graphics (and Low as well if you like lol) on Android

Also adds the graphics button in the options layer so you can show your FPS in the advanced menu


Special thanks to:
- CatXus and Jaid, for testing this mod with me :D
- Erymanthus/RayDeeUx, for creating this mod's icon
- NourTheKing, for finding a single obscure bug but still wants to be in the credits
